  Guidance on using unified distributed storage with fleet.
---

In this tutorial, we will cover how to implement unified distributed storage on a set of clusters, using [Fleet](https://kurator.dev/docs/references/fleet-api/#fleet)

## Architecture

Fleet's unified distributed storage is built on top of [Rook](https://rook.io/), and the overall architecture is shown as below:

    >}}

## Prerequisites

### 1. Fleet Manager Setup

Set up the Fleet manager by following the instructions in the [installation guide](/docs/setup/install-fleet-manager/).

### 2. Rook prerequisites

To support Kurator's Unified Distributed Storage, you must first configure the Distributed Storage plug-in for [Fleet](https://kurator.dev/docs/references/fleet-api/#fleet). Kurator uses [Rook](https://rook.io) as the Distributed Storage plugin. These are some of the prerequisites needed to use rook.

1. Kubernetes v1.22 or higher is supported
1. To configure the Ceph storage cluster, at least one of these local storage types is required:

   - Raw devices (no partitions or formatted filesystems)
   - Raw partitions (no formatted filesystem)
   - LVM Logical Volumes (no formatted filesystem)
   - Persistent Volumes available from a storage class in `block` mode

The easiest way to do this is to mount an Raw disk on the nodes.

### 3. Secrets and Setup for Attached Clusters

In Kurator, clusters not created by Kurator are called AttachedClusters. Kurator provides the ability to incorporate these AttachedClusters into the kurator fleet management and implement unified distributed storage on these attachedclusters with fleet. Therefore we need a fleet that already manages several AttachedClusters. Specific operations can be referred to [Manage AttachedCluster](https://kurator.dev/docs/fleet-manager/manage-attachedcluster/).

## Create a Fleet with the DistributedStorage Plugin Enabled

Run following command to create rook operator and rook ceph cluster in the Fleet:

```console
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: fleet.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Fleet
metadata:
  name: quickstart
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusters:
    - name: kurator-member1
      kind: AttachedCluster
    - name: kurator-member2
      kind: AttachedCluster
  plugin:
    distributedStorage:
      storage:
        dataDirHostPath: /var/lib/rook
        monitor:
          count: 3
          labels:
            role: MonitorNodeLabel
        manager:
          count: 2
          labels:
            role: ManagerNodeLabel
EOF
```

### Fleet DistributedStorage Plugin Configuration Explained

Let's delve into the `spec` section of the above Fleet:

- `clusters`: Contains the two `AttachedCluster` objects created earlier, indicating that the distributedstorage plugin will be installed in these two clusters.
- `plugin`: The `distributedStorage` indicates the configuration of a distributedstorage plugin. `dataDirHostPath` defines the directory in which the rook-ceph cluster will save the cluster configuration. `monitor` and `manager` provide configuration for the mon and mgr components of ceph. For more configuration options, please refer to the [Fleet API](https://kurator.dev/docs/references/fleet-api/).
- In addition to the configuration fields mentioned above, kurator also provides `storage.devices` field that allows you to specify the use of device mounted in a specific directory (such as /dev/sda) on all nodes in the cluster. And `storage.nodes` field that allows you to specify the use of storage resources on specific nodes. It is also possible to specify the devices to be used. For more configuration options, please refer to the [Fleet API](https://kurator.dev/docs/references/fleet-api/).

## Verify the Installation

To ensure that the distributedstorage plugin is successfully installed and running, run the following commands:

```console
kubectl get po -A -n rook-ceph --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
kubectl get po -A -n rook-ceph --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member2.config
```

After waiting for some time check the status of all pods under the rook-ceph namespace. The result is shown below:

```console

## Persistent Volume Use Guide

After rook opeartor and rook ceph cluster are installed, this chapter provides examples of using Block Storage, Filesystem Storage and Object Storage.

### Block Storage Class Configuration

Block storage allows a single pod to mount storage. This section how to create a block storage persistent volume kubernetes pod that uses the block storage provided by Rook.

The `StorageClass` and `CephBlockPool` need to be created before the Rook can configure storage.This will allow Kubernetes to interact with the Rook when configuring persistent volumes.

Run the following commands, can create a `CephBlockPool`:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephBlockPool
metadata:
  name: replicapool
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  failureDomain: host
  replicated:
    size: 3
EOF
```

Run the following commands, can create a block mod `StorageClass`:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
   name: rook-ceph-block
provisioner: rook-ceph.rbd.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
    clusterID: rook-ceph
    pool: replicapool
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

There are a few things to note in the above block storage class configuration:

- provisioner is configured in the format (operator-namespace).rbd.csi.ceph.com. Change "rook-ceph" provisioner prefix to match the operator namespace if needed.
- `parametes.clusterID` is the namespace where the rook cluster is running.
- `parametes.pool` is the `CephBlockPool` created before.

### FileSystem Storage Class Configuration

A filesystem storage (also named shared filesystem) can be mounted with read/write permission from multiple pods. This may be useful for applications which can be clustered using a shared filesystem.This section describes how to create a kubernetes pod of file storage persistent volumes using the file storage provided by Rook.

Using the file storage provided by Rook, you can set up the metadatapool, datapool, and metadata server, all of which can be set up in the `CephFileSystem`. Run the following commands, can create a `CephFileSystem`:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephFilesystem
metadata:
  name: ceph-filesystem
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  metadataPool:
    replicated:
      size: 3
  dataPools: 
    - name: data0
      replicated:
        size: 3
  preserveFilesystemOnDelete: true
  metadataServer:
    activeCount: 1
    activeStandby: true
```

The Rook operator will create all the pools and other resources necessary to start the service.  `Mds` stands for metadata service and is the metadata service that the ceph filesystem service relies on. The metadata and configuration information of the filesystem store is managed by mds. To confirm the filesystem is configured, wait for the mds pods to start.

```console
kubectl get po -n rook-ceph -l app=rook-ceph-mds
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-mds-ceph-filesystem-a-65688966df-5zq7d         2/2     Running      0          32h
rook-ceph-mds-ceph-filesystem-a-6d5dcb85b6-k8pqr         2/2     Running      0          32h
```

Before you can use the file storage provided by Rook, you need to create a storage class for the file storage type, which is required for Kubernetes to interoperate with the CSI driver to create persistent volumes. Apply this storage class definition as:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: rook-cephfs
provisioner: rook-ceph.cephfs.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  clusterID: rook-ceph
  fsName: ceph-filesystem
  pool: data0
reclaimPolicy: Delete
EOF
```

There are a few things to note in the above filesystem storage class configuration:

- provisioner is configured in the format (operator-namespace).cephfs.csi.ceph.com. Change "rook-ceph" provisioner prefix to match the operator namespace if needed.
- `parameters.fsName` and `parameters.pool` needs to correspond to the name created in `CephFileSystem`.

### Object Storage Class Configuration

In Rook, object storage exposes the S3 API to the storage cluster so that applications in the cluster can store data. As same as file storage, object storage requires metadata pool, data pool, and rgw a specific plug-in to support object storage. All of this can be set up in the `CephObjectStorage`. Run the following commands, can create a `CephObjectStorage`:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephObjectStore
metadata:
  name: ceph-objectstorage
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  metadataPool:
    failureDomain: host
    replicated:
      size: 3
  dataPool:
    failureDomain: host
    erasureCoded:
      dataChunks: 2
      codingChunks: 1
  preservePoolsOnDelete: true
  gateway:
    sslCertificateRef:
    port: 80
    instances: 1
EOF
```

The Rook operator will create all the pools and other resources necessary to start the service. To confirm the object storage is configured, wait for the rgw pods to start:

```console
kubectl get po -n rook-ceph -l app=rook-ceph-rgw
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-rgw-ceph-objectstore-a-5c4df48bbb-bf6jn        2/2     Running      0          32h
```

Now that the object store is configured, we next need to create a storage bucket that will allow clients to read and write objects. Buckets can be created by defining storage classes, similar to the pattern used for block and file storage. Apply this storage class definition as:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
   name: rook-ceph-bucket
provisioner: rook-ceph.ceph.rook.io/bucket
reclaimPolicy: Delete
parameters:
  objectStoreName: ceph-objectstore
  objectStoreNamespace: rook-ceph
EOF
```

There are a few things to note in the above filesystem storage class configuration:

- provisioner is configured in the format (operator-namespace).ceph.rook.io/bucket. Change "rook-ceph" provisioner prefix to match the operator namespace if needed.
- `parameters.objectStorageName` needs to correspond to the name created in `CephObjectStorage`

### Use Block Storage

After creating the storagec class for block, file and object storage, it's time to actually use this storage class. We can ues Kurator application to create Persistent Volume Claim and Pod that consume it.

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: blockstorage-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    gitRepository:
      interval: 3m0s
      ref:
        branch: main
      timeout: 1m0s
      url: https://github.com/kurator-dev/kurator
  syncPolicies:
    - destination:
        fleet: quickstart
      kustomization:
        interval: 5m0s
        path: ./examples/fleet/distributedstorage/blockstore
        prune: true
        timeout: 2m0s
EOF
```

The above command creates a nginx-blockstorage pod and mounts Persistent Volume in its own Pod. You can run the following command to see the kubernetes volume claims:

```console
kubectl get pvc -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
NAME          STATUS     VOLUME                                       CAPACITY      ACCESSMODES     AGE
block-pvc     Bound      pvc-n6w5hd42-sx7w-f996-7bdc-l7d4c78b74b8    1Gi           RWO             3m
```

### Use Filesystem Storage

Filesystem storage is similar to block storage, we also can ues Kurator application to create Persistent Volume Claim and Pod that consume it.

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: filesystemstorage-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    gitRepository:
      interval: 3m0s
      ref:
        branch: main
      timeout: 1m0s
      url: https://github.com/kurator-dev/kurator
  syncPolicies:
    - destination:
        fleet: quickstart
      kustomization:
        interval: 5m0s
        path: ./examples/fleet/distributedstorage/filesystemstore
        prune: true
        timeout: 2m0s
EOF
```

The above command creates a nginx-filesystemstorage pod and mounts Persistent Volume in its own Pod. You can run the following command to see the kubernetes volume claims:

```console
kubectl get pvc -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
NAME          STATUS     VOLUME               CAPACITY      ACCESSMODES     AGE
cephfs-pvc    Bound      filesystem-volume    1Gi           RWO             1h
```

### Use Object Storage

In a rook-ceph cluster, the use of object storage is different from the use of block storage and filesystem storage. `ObjectBucketClaim` is used instead of PersistentVolumeClaim. And the application needs secret and configmap to access the objectbucket. When Pod use object storage, they don't mount PVC like block storage and filesystem storage, but instead uniquely specify the ObjectBucketClaim with secret and configmap.

We stil can can ues Kurator application to create ObjectBucketClaim and Pod that consume it, but there will be some changes to the configuration.

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: objectstorage-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    gitRepository:
      interval: 3m0s
      ref:
        branch: main
      timeout: 1m0s
      url: https://github.com/kurator-dev/kurator
  syncPolicies:
    - destination:
        fleet: quickstart
      kustomization:
        interval: 5m0s
        path: ./examples/fleet/distributedstorage/objectstore
        prune: true
        timeout: 2m0s
EOF
```

The above command creates a redis-objectstorage pod and use a object bucket in its own Pod. You can run the following command to see the Pod:

```console
kubectl get po --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-objectstorage      1/1     Running   0          3m37s
```

## Cleanup

This section guides you through the process of cleaning up the fleets and plugins.

### 1. Cleanup the Backup Plugin

If you only need to remove the distributedstorage plugin, simply edit the current fleet and remove the corresponding description:

```console
kubectl edit fleet.fleet.kurator.dev quickstart
```

To check the results of the deletion, you can observe that the Velero components have been removed:

```console
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member2.config
```

Perhaps there are still some rook components left over, which can be executed by running the following command:

```console
kubectl api-resources --verbs=list --namespaced -o name | xargs -n 1 kubectl get --show-kind --ignore-not-found -n rook-ceph --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
kubectl api-resources --verbs=list --namespaced -o name | xargs -n 1 kubectl get --show-kind --ignore-not-found -n rook-ceph --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member2.config
```

After getting undeleted rook components, you can delete it by editing its configuration file via `kubectl edit` and removing its finalizer.

More information on removing a Rook can be found at [rook cleanup guide](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.12/Storage-Configuration/ceph-teardown/)

If you wish to reinstall the components later, you can simply edit the fleet and add the necessary configurations.

### 2. Cleanup the Fleet

When the fleet is deleted, all associated plugins will also be removed:

```console
kubectl delete fleet.fleet.kurator.dev quickstart
```
